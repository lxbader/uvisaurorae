  DESCRIPTION                   = "This UVIS Qube is a 3 dimensional matrix
    of 2 byte integers.  The Qube represents a time series of two dimensional
    (spectral x spatial) matrices.  Each two dimensional matrix is made up of
    counts taken by the detector during a fixed time interval.  The fixed
    time interval is specified in the INTEGRATION_DURATION keyword.  If the
    two dimensional matrix has a LINE magnitude of 1 then the Qube is a time
    series of spectra.  The region of the detector in which data was taken is
    defined by the ...CORNER keywords.
       This object is organized so that a sequence of 1024 2-byte numbers
    forms a horizontal line (the BAND dimension), a sequence of 64 lines
    forms an BANDxLINE spectral-spatial matrix, and sequence of 1,151 of
    these matrices, forms a (1024x64x1151)  Qube.
      The purpose of this observation is to obtain EUV & FUV spectral
  images of Saturn containing the auroral zone."
