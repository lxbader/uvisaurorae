   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the Cassini Radio Science Subsytem

Version and Date
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the ISS I-kernel might have an entry as follows:

   Version 0.3 -- April 18, 2003 -- Lee Elson
 
            --   Added a new instrument, X BAND TRUE, that contains the old X
                 BAND instrument FOV definitions. Altered X BAND definitions
                 so that they are the same as Ka band. This is necessary
                 because of the way that the uplink software uses the
                 information. See the updated frame kernel for more
                 information. The ID for X BAND TRUE is -82186, the name is
                 CASSINI_RSS_HGA_X_TRUE.
 
   Version 0.2 -- April 23, 2001 -- Scott Turner
 
            --   Updated kernel to utilize new FOV ANGLES specification.
 
   Version 0.1 -- November 2, 2000 -- Scott Turner
 
            --   Fixed a formatting error in the FOV size table.
 
            --   In the previous version, the SBAND pixel parameter keywords
                 were mistakenly omitted. They have been added.

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the RSS instruments. (KABAND = 180, KUBAND = 181,
   SBAND = 182 , XBAND = 183, LGA1 = 184, LGA2 = 185, XBAND_TRUE = 186 ).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the KABAND boresight direction in the
   KABAND frame (``CASSINI_KABAND'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82180_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
RSS description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   Radio science experiments use the spacecraft radio and ground antennas
   (such as those of NASA's Deep Space Network) as the science instrument.
   These experiments measure the refractions, Doppler shifts, and other
   modifications to radio signals that occur when the spacecraft is "occulted"
   by (i.e., passes behind) planets, moons, atmospheres, and physical features
   such as planetary rings. From these measurements, scientists can derive
   information about the structures and compositions of the occulting bodies,
   atmospheres, and rings.
 
   The Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) will use the spacecraft X-band
   communication link as well as the S-band downlink and the Ka-band uplink
   and downlink to study the compositions, pressures, and temperatures of the
   atmospheres and ionospheres of Saturn and Titan; the radial structure of
   Saturn's rings and the particle size distribution within the rings; and
   body and system masses within the Saturnian system. It will also be used to
   search for gravitational waves coming from beyond our solar system. The RSS
   consists of a Ka-band traveling wave tube amplifier, a translator, an
   exciter; an S-band transmitter; and various microwave components. For more
   information on these components, see below. (NOTE: Before proceeding, you
   may wish to review the description of the Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFS).
 
   The purpose of the Ka-band traveling wave tube amplifier (K-TWTA)
   subassembly is to amplify the signals going to the high-gain antenna to the
   power level necessary for them to be received by the Deep Space Network.
   The K-TWTA subassembly consists of the a traveling wave tube (TWT) and an
   electronic power conditioner (EPC). The nonredundant TWT is the signal
   amplifier. It can be commanded into a standby mode for low d.c. power
   consumption. The EPC converts d.c. power from the Power and Pyrotechnic
   Subsystem (PPS) to the voltages required to operate the TWT. It can power
   the TWT in the standby mode or power down the TWT in case of TWT or EPC
   fault detection. The EPC also supplies engineering telemetry to the RFS and
   provides direct-access signals.
 
   The Ka-band translator (KAT) subassembly receives the 34-GHz uplink carrier
   from the high-gain antenna and translates it by a factor of 14/15 for
   retransmission back to the DSN. The phase and phase-shift of the signal are
   used for the actual science observations and measurements. The KAT contains
   a power converter that allows it to operate from the 30-volt d.c. power
   bus. It also supplies engineering telemetry data to the RFS and provides
   for direct access.
 
   The Ka-band exciter (KEX) generates a stable 32-GHz signal and provides an
   RF power combiner to combine the RF signal generated by the KAT with its
   own signal. It is powered by the 30-volt spacecraft bus, and it supplies
   telemetry data to the RFS and provides direct access.
 
   The S-band transmitter (SBT) receives a 115-MHz signal from the RFS,
   multiplies it by 20, amplifies it to 10 watts, and supplies the resultant
   signal at approximately 2290 MHz to the high-gain antenna. This carrier
   signal is used for radio science experiments. The transmitter contains a
   power converter to allow operation from the 30-volt power bus, and it
   supplies telemetry data to the RFS and provides direct access.
 
   The microwave components consist of two band pass filters (BPFs) and
   waveguide components. BPFs are filters that allow only certain wavelengths
   of microwave energy to pass, with all other wavelengths being blocked. In
   this case, the BPFs permit reception and transmission of the Ka-band
   signals using different antenna feed polarizations and provide isolation
   between the transmit and receive frequencies. Waveguide is essentially
   tubing of precise dimensions that provides a path for microwave energy of a
   certain wavelength. In this subsystem it is used for all Ka-band microwave
   component interconnections.
 
 
RSS Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The field of view parameters for the six instruments that constitute the
   RSS are:
 
            --   KA Band (KABAND)
 
            --   KU Band (KUBAND)
 
            --   S Band (SBAND)
 
            --   X Band (XBAND)
 
            --   X Band True (XBAND_TRUE)
 
            --   Low Gain Antenna 1 (LGA1)
 
            --   Low Gain Antenna 2 (LGA2)
 
           Circular FOV:
 
           ------------  -----------------------
               Beam             Diameter
           ------------  -----------------------
              KABAND        0.19022199 degrees
 
              KUBAND        0.350 degrees
 
               SBAND        2.14859180 degrees
 
               XBAND        0.19022199 degrees (forced identical to KABAND)
 
               XBAND_TRUE   0.55977977 degrees
 
               LGA1          0.010 degrees
 
               LGA2          0.010 degrees
           ------------  -----------------------
 
   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   FOV ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe the
   instrument field of view. Since the beams have circular fields of view, the
   INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE will be 'CIRCLE'. GETFOV returns a single vector that
   lies along the edge of the circular cone. All six FOV boresights lie along
   the Z-axis.
 
 
KA Band (KABAND) FOV Definition
 
   Since the KABAND's FOV is circular and its diameter is 0.19022199 degrees,
   looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_KABAND frame, we have: (Note we are
   arbitrarily choosing a vector that terminates in the Z=1 plane.)

   is:
 
           Y Component = 1.0 * tan ( 0.095110995 degrees )

   The following values were provided as samples in [5]. These values are
   defined in [5] as follows:
 
 
           ``The initial values for the following keywords are given
           per instrument number:
 
           INS[instrument number]_[instrument acronym]_MODE_NAME
           INS[instrument number]_[instrument acronym]_TRIGGER_OFFSET
           INS[instrument number]_[instrument acronym]_CYCLE_DURATION
 
           INS..._MODE_NAME contains the name of the instrument mode for
           the INS..._TRIGGER_OFFSET and INS..._CYCLE_DURATION
           keywords.
 
           INS..._TRIGGER_OFFSET specifies the reference time of the
           first instrument frame (to be calculated for a footprint)
           relative to the time of transacting the corresponding TRIGGER
           command. The units are SFOC duration.
 
           INS..._CYCLE_DURATION specifies the duration between successive
           instrument frames (from the first one) for the INS..._MODE_NAME.''
