Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the CAPS instruments. (IMS = 820, ELS = 821, IBS1
   = 822, IBS2 = 823, IBS3 = 824).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the CAPS IMS boresight direction in the
   CAPS/ACTS frame (``CASSINI_CAPS'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82820_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
CAPS Description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer Subsystem (CAPS) will measure the flux
   (i.e., the flow rate or density) of ions as a function of mass per charge
   and the flux of ions and electrons as a function of energy per charge and
   angle of arrival relative to the CAPS instrument. The CAPS Subsystem
   consists of six major subassemblies: the ion mass spectrometer, the ion
   beam spectrometer, the electron spectrometer, a data processing unit, a
   high-voltage power supply, and an actuator. For information about these
   components, see below.
 
   (CAPS)
 
   The ion mass spectrometer (IMS) provides species-resolved measurements of
   the flux of positively charged atomic and molecular ions as a function of
   energy/charge vs aperture entry direction. The IMS uses a toroidal top-hat
   electrostatic analyzer (for energy/charge data and to create a narrow field
   of view) combined with a linear electric field time-of-flight mass
   spectrometer (for mass/charge and other species-resolving data). The IMS
   consists of an aperture cover/actuator, a toroidal analyzer, carbon foils,
   a time-of-flight spectrometer, microchannel plates,
   amplifier/discriminators, a time-to-digital converter, a spectrum analyzer
   module, and high-voltage power converters contained in high-voltage units 1
   and 2. For information on these components, see below.
 
   (IMS)
 
   The IMS aperture cover protects the IMS during ground handling and during
   launch and early flight. The cover is a strip of flexible material that
   fits over the IMS annular aperture without creating a hermetic seal. To
   open the cover the strip is reeled into a container by a spring after the
   strip is released by a wax thermal actuator (WTA). Closing the cover
   requires ground handling to unreel the cover and re-attach its end to the
   cover-release mechanism. Thus, in flight, the aperture cover is a one-time
   use device.
 
   The toroidal analyzer (toroidal refers to the configuration of the target
   reflector) consists of a baffled collimator (a device used to create a
   parallel beam of particles) mounted on a toroidal ``top hat'' electrostatic
   analyzer. The geometry of the collimator determines the narrow, annular
   (i.e., ring-shaped) IMS field of view of 12 degrees by 160 degrees, which
   is divided into eight angular ``pixels'' of 12 degrees by 20 degrees each.
   An electric potential between the inner and outer conductors of the
   electrostatic analyzer allows through this device only ions having energies
   within a range selected by the analyzer potential (i.e., only ions with
   certain energies will have trajectories, at a given analyzer potential,
   that navigate through the analyzer without being stopped by hitting a
   wall). Energy spectra are taken by stepping the analyzer potential through
   a set of 64 spaced values.
 
   Eight thin carbon foils are arranged in an arc along the exit of the
   toroidal analyzer. The foils are the entrance to the time-of-flight
   spectrometer chamber formed by the linear electric field (LEF) rings. A -15
   kV potential accelerates the positive ions exiting the toroidal analyzer
   into the foils, and this permits ions entering the IMS with as little as 1
   eV of energy to pass through the foils. Molecular ions traveling through
   the foils are usually broken into their constituent atoms and/or molecular
   fragments. Molecular and atomic ions and molecular fragments exit the foils
   as neutrals or ions, and upon exiting the neutrals and ions eject secondary
   electrons into the time-of-flight chamber.
 
   The time-of-flight spectrometer is a cylindrical chamber in the IMS,
   bounded by linear electric field (LEF) rings, where particles exiting the
   carbon foils encounter an electric field with a strength that increases
   linearly with distance parallel to the LEF axis of symmetry. The linear
   electric field is generated by a stack of thirty equally spaced aluminum
   rings along which a network of gigaohmn resistors establishes a quadratic
   electric potential with a total potential drop across the stack of rings of
   30 kV.
 
   The LEF focuses positively charged particles with energies up to
   approximately 15 KeV, independently of the energy and angle with which they
   exit the carbon foils. Microchannel plate (MCP) multipliers are located at
   the ends of the stack of LEF rings. Detection by the ``start'' (ST) MCP of
   rapidly travelling secondary electrons from the carbon foils is used as a
   time-of-flight ``start'' signal and for determining an ion's elevation
   angle with respect to the IMS aperture. Simple harmonic motion of ions in
   the LEF, together with knowledge of their energy gained from the toroidal
   analyzer setting, relates their time-of-flight, from carbon foils to the
   LEF MCP (at the other end of the chamber from the ST MCP), to mass per
   charge.
 
   The two microchannel plates (MCPs) each consist of three circular plates of
   lead oxide glass with a multitude of microscopic channels running at an
   incline through the thickness of each plate. Electrons, ions, and neutrals
   striking the outer plate cause secondary electrons to cascade down the
   semiconductive walls of the channels. With a potential drop of about 1 kV
   across the thickness of a plate, there is a yield of about 300 electrons
   per incident particle, or a total gain of 106 electrons across the
   three-plate stack.
 
   Nine anodes under the ST MCP and one anode under the LEF MCP collect the
   electrons emitted from the MCPs and pass the signals to two high-speed
   current amplifiers (one ``start'' amplifier for the eight 20-degree-wide
   anodes, and one ``stop'' amplifier for the LEF anode and the center ST
   anode). Two constant fraction discriminators accept the amplifiers' signals
   and send digital timing pulses (independent of the amplifiers' signal
   amplitude) to the time-to-digital converter (TDC). Also sent to the TDC is
   the identification of which of the eight annular anodes was the source of
   the ``start'' pulse and whether a ``stop'' pulse came from the LEF anode or
   the center ST anode.
 
   The time-to-digital converter (TDC) measures the time interval between the
   start and stop pulses from the amplifier/discriminators. The TDC outputs an
   interval length to the spectrum analyzer module, along with information
   identifying the ``start'' anode and the ``stop'' anode. The ``start'' anode
   identity determines which of the eight 20-degree-wide IMS elevation
   resolution elements an ion entered through. A device in the TDC (a pulser)
   can inject simulated MCP signals just downstream of the MCP anodes, via
   high-voltage isolating capacitors, in order to test the signal handling
   functions of the IMS and related hardware and software in the CAPS data
   processing unit.
 
   The spectrum analyzer module (SAM) provides the data gathering, sorting,
   and transfer functions between the TDC and the data processing unit (DPU).
   Time interval data from the TDC are ``binned'' or grouped into a
   pre-selected (by the DPU) set of time channels associated with certain
   selected ion species, whether atomic or molecular. The SAM processor
   performs a deconvolution of the time-of-flight spectra to obtain ion
   identifications, which it passes on to the DPU.
 
   The IMS has four programmable pulse width-modulated high-voltage power
   converters . These converters supply high voltage to the toroidal analyzer,
   the LEF rings, and the LEF MCP.
 
   The second major CAPS subassembly is the ion beam spectrometer (IBS). The
   IBS measures the flux of positively charged ions of all species as a
   function of energy/charge and aperture entry direction. The IBS consists of
   a hemispherical electrostatic analyzer, channel electron multipliers,
   amplifiers/discriminators, and high-voltage power converters. For
   information on these components, see below.
 
   (IBS)
 
   The hemispherical electrostatic analyzer consists of two conductive
   hemispheres of slightly different radius, mounted concentrically one within
   the other in such a way that there is a small gap between the two
   conductors. The electric field in the gap selects the range of energy per
   charge and angular direction that ions are allowed to have in order to pass
   through the analyzer. Energy spectra are taken by stepping the analyzer
   potential through a set of spaced values. Three apertures, each defining a
   field of view of 1.5 degrees by 150 degrees, spaced 30 degrees apart, allow
   particles to enter the analyzer. Particles are ``focused'' into three
   channel electron multipliers 180 degrees from each of the entrance
   apertures.
 
   Ions entering the channel electron multipliers (CEMs) strike the inner
   semiconducting surfaces of the devices and spawn secondary electrons, which
   bounce down the curved channel in the CEMs, spawning more electrons with
   each bounce. In this way, the entry of an ion into a CEM results in a pulse
   of approximately 108 electrons being collected by an anode at the exit of
   the CEM.
 
   The amplifiers/discriminators amplify the electron pulses collected by the
   CEM anodes and send the signals to the DPU's IBS interface. A device in the
   IBS (a pulser) can inject simulated CEM signals just downstream of the CEM
   anodes in order to test the signal handling functions of the IBS and
   related hardware and software in the DPU.
 
   The IBS has two programmable pulse width-modulated high-voltage power
   converters, which supply high voltage to the hemispherical analyzer and the
   CEMs.
 
   The third major CAPS subassembly is the electron spectrometer (ELS), which
   measures the flux of electrons as a function of energy/charge and aperture
   entry direction. The ELS consists of a spherical analyzer, microchannel
   plates, amplifiers/discriminators, a sensor management unit, and
   high-voltage power converters. For information on these components, see
   below.
 
   (ELS)
 
   The spherical analyzer consists of a baffled collimator mounted on a
   spherical ``top hat'' electrostatic analyzer. Collimator geometry
   determines the narrow, annular ELS field of view of 5 degrees by 160
   degrees, which is divided into eight 20-degree ``pixels.'' An electric
   potential between the inner and outer conductors of the electrostatic
   analyzer allows through this device only electrons having energies and
   angles within a range selected by the analyzer potential and top-hat
   collimation. Energy spectra are taken by stepping the analyzer potential
   through a set of 96 spaced values.
 
   Two 90-degree ``long'' annular (i.e., curved) microchannel plates (MCPs)
   are arranged in a 180-degree arc along the exit of the spherical analyzer.
   electrons striking the surface of the MCPs are multiplied into signals
   collected by an arc of eight 20-degree anodes.
 
   The anode signals are passed into eight amplifiers/discriminators via
   high-voltage isolating capacitors and are then accumulated by the sensor
   management unit. The anode identity determines which of the eight
   20-degree-wide ELS elevation resolution elements an electron entered
   through.
 
   The sensor management unit (SMU) controls the voltage level of the ELS
   high-voltage power converters in accordance with requests from the CAPS
   data processing unit (DPU) and passes counts of electrons (from each of the
   eight angular resolution elements) detected by the ELS to the DPU. A device
   in the SMU (a pulser) can inject simulated MCP signals just downstream of
   the isolating capacitors in order to test the signal handling functions of
   the ELS and related hardware and software in the DPU.
 
   The ELS has two programmable pulse width-modulated high-voltage power
   converters that supply high voltage to the spherical analyzer and the MCPs.
 
   The fourth major CAPS subassembly is the data processing unit (DPU). The
   DPU manages the acquisition and onboard data processing of all CAPS data
   and controls sensor and actuator motor functions. The DPU is designed to
   use two CPUs, in addition to the processor in the spectrum analyzer module.
   The first CPU accumulates IMS time-of-flight spectra and compresses all IMS
   data. The other CPU controls the IMS, ELS, IBS, and the actuator and
   performs onboard data analysis to determine what measurements will be taken
   and what data will be placed into housekeeping and science packets.
 
   The DPU consists of the sensor and actuator data control interfaces, a
   housekeeping analog-to-digital converter, a safe/arm control, a wax thermal
   actuator (WTA) driver, CPUs with memory, a bus interface unit, low-voltage
   power converters, supplemental and replacement heaters, a radiator, and the
   principal structure of CAPS. For information on these components, see
   below.
 
   (DPU)
 
   Through its sensor and actuator data control interfaces, the DPU performs
   several functions. It accumulates IBS ion flux counts; it collects ELS and
   IMS data products from the SMU, the TDC, and the SAM; and it directly
   controls the IMS and IBS pulsers and high-voltage converters. The DPU feeds
   ion energy/charge data to, and controls, the SAM. In addition, the DPU
   controls the CAPS actuator (ACT) motor stepping and accepts position and
   status data from the ACT.
 
   The output voltage of all nine CAPS high-voltage converters, CAPS low
   voltages, the actuator position encoder, and the temperature at six
   different locations in CAPS are monitored by a housekeeping
   analog-to-digital converter. In addition, two temperature sensors (one in
   the DPU, the other in the IMS cover release mechanism) are monitored
   directly by the spacecraft. These two sensors do not require that CAPS be
   powered.
 
   When not enabled by the DPU (via CAPS software), all high-voltage power
   converters have zero potential. When high-voltage converters are enabled, a
   safe/arm connector on the DPU can be used during ground handling to limit
   high voltages to approximately 3 percent of what the DPU has commanded them
   to be.
 
   The wax thermal actuators (WTAs) in the IMS cover release mechanism and the
   scan motor launch latch are driven and switched by a WTA driver in the DPU.
 
   The DPU uses two nearly identical CPU boards, each containing its own RAM,
   ROM, and PACE 1750a microprocessor.
 
   CAPS communicates with the Command and Data Subsystem (CDS) via a bus
   interface unit (BIU) that is electrically, mechanically, and thermally
   accommodated within the DPU.
 
   All CAPS low-voltage power converters are housed in the DPU. Power at
   various voltages is supplied for use by the electronics boards in the DPU,
   including the BIU, and by the amplifiers, D/A converters, and other
   circuitry housed in the IMS, ELS, IBS, and ACT.
 
   The CAPS supplemental heater (controlled by CAPS) and replacement heater
   (controlled by the spacecraft) are mounted to the inside of the DPU's top
   plate.
 
   The CAPS radiator mounts to the back plate of the DPU.
 
   Along with the actuator, the DPU box forms the principal structure of CAPS.
   The IMS, ELS, IBS, and the high-voltage power supplies mount to the top
   plate of the DPU. CAPS mounts to the spacecraft via the actuator, which is
   mounted to the bottom plate of the DPU.
 
   The fifth major subassembly of the CAPS instrument is the high-voltage
   power supply. Two redundant power supplies, HVU1 and HVU2, mount to the top
   plate of the DPU.
 
   The last subassembly of CAPS is the actuator (ACT). The ACT will rotate the
   CAPS instrument at a steady rate over a maximum range of 184 degrees with
   the acceleration/deceleration over a further 12 degrees (minimum) at either
   end of this range. The steady rate and acceleration/deceleration range can
   be adjusted in-flight, and the 216-degree total range of movement will be
   limited by hard stops to prevent any ``wraparound'' effects on the CAPS
   interface cables.

   The CAPS instruments are mounted on an actuator which allows the fields of
   view to be rotated through +- 104 deg. The rotation is about the Z axis of
   the Cassini spacecraft. The CAPS frame is defined to be identical to the
   Cassini spacecraft frame, when the actuator angle is zero.
 
   The FOVs of the CAPS detectors have the following angular sizes:

Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) FOV Definition
 
   The Ion Mass Spectrometer has a 154.5 deg by 8.3 deg field of view (full
   width at half maximum), with a boresight along the -Y axis of the
   CASSINI_CAPS frame. It has eight pixels, 14.5 by 8.3 deg (FWHM), spaced
   evenly in along the length of the field of view.
 
   Since the IMS FOV is rectangular, GETFOV will return four boundary corner
   vectors. To visualize these vectors requires two separate views. First
   consider looking up the X-axis at the X=0 plane, which permits the
   computation of the the Z components of the boundary corner vectors. In this
   plane, the half angle of note is 77.25 degrees.

Electron Spectrometer (ELS) FOV Definition
 
   The Electron Spectrometer has a 160 deg by 5.24-6.5 deg field of view (full
   width at half maximum), with a boresight along the -Y axis of the
   CASSINI_CAPS frame. It has eight pixels, 20 by 5.24-6.5 deg (FWHM), spaced
   evenly in along the length of the field of view. Laboratory calibration
   data shows that the width of the ELS field of view depends on the energy of
   the electrons being observed. Simulations give a width of 5.24 deg;
   measurements of 125 eV electrons, 6.45 deg; 960 eV electrons, 5.68 deg. In
   this IK, a value of 6.45 is used.
 
   Since the ELS FOV is rectangular, GETFOV returns four boundary corner
   vectors. To visualize these vectors requires two separate views. First
   consider looking up the X-axis at the X=0 plane, which permits the
   computation of the Z components of the boundary corner vectors. In this
   plane, the half angle of note is 80 degrees.

Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS) FOV Definition
 
   The Ion Beam Spectrometer has three detectors, each with a 150 deg by 1.4
   deg field of view (full width at half maximum) and boresighted along the -Y
   axis of the CASSINI_CAPS frame. Detector 2's field of view is aligned with
   the Y-Z plane, while Detectors 1 and 3 are rotated 30 degrees clockwise and
   counter-clockwise about the boresight axis respectively.
 
   Since all of the IBS detectors are rectangular, GETFOV returns four
   boundary corner vectors for each detector. Since the IBS_DT2 FOV is aligned
   with the CASSINI_CAPS frame axis, one can easily visualize the boundary
   corner vectors associated with it.
 
   Begin by looking up the X-axis at the X=0 plane, which permits the
   computation of the Z components of the boundary corner vectors. In this
   plane, the half angle of note is 75 degrees.

   Since the field of view is rectangular a similar calculation yields the X
   components. This time, look down the Z-axis at the Z=0 plane. The half
   angle of interest is 0.7 degrees.

Instrument Mode Timing
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The following values were provided as samples in [5]. The values are
   defined in [5] as follows:
 
 
           ``The initial values for the following keywords are given
           per instrument number:
 
           INS[instrument number]_[instrument acronym]_MODE_NAME
           INS[instrument number]_[instrument acronym]_TRIGGER_OFFSET
           INS[instrument number]_[instrument acronym]_CYCLE_DURATION
 
           INS..._MODE_NAME contains the name of the instrument mode for
           the INS..._TRIGGER_OFFSET and INS..._CYCLE_DURATION
           keywords.
 
           INS..._TRIGGER_OFFSET specifies the reference time of the
           first instrument frame (to be calculated for a footprint)
           relative to the time of transacting the corresponding TRIGGER
           command. The units are SFOC duration.
 
           INS..._CYCLE_DURATION specifies the duration between successive
           instrument frames (from the first one) for the INS..._MODE_NAME.''
 
 
   The CAPS sensors operate on a 32 second ``A cycle'', and time of flight
   mass spectra are produced every ``B cycle''. The number of A cycles per B
   cycle is mode dependent.
