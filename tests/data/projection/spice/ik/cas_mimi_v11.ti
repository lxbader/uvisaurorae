   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the Cassini Magnetospheric Imaging

Version and Date

   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the ISS I-kernel might have an entry as follows:

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the MIMI detectors. (CHEMS = 760, INCA = 761,
   LEMMS1 = 762 , LEMMS2 = 763 ).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the MIMI_CHEMS boresight direction in
   the MIMI_CHEMS frame (``CASSINI_MIMI_CHEMS'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82760_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
MIMI description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   The Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) will provide global images of
   Saturnian hot plasmas remotely and will perform comprehensive direct
   measurements of hot plasma, including charge state and elemental
   composition.
 
   The MIMI instrument consists of one set of electronics, the MIMI
   electronics box, servicing three detector heads that perform the various
   measurements: the low-energy magnetospheric measurements system (LEMMS),
   the charge-energy-mass spectrometer (CHEMS), and the ion and neutral camera
   (INCA). For information on these components, see below.
 
   (MIMI)
 
   The MIMI electronics box contains the data processing unit (DPU) and the
   digital processing electronics for all three detector heads.
 
   The low-energy magnetospheric measurements system (LEMMS) detector head
   will measure low- and high-energy proton, ion, and electron angular
   distributions. The LEMMS head is mounted on a scan platform capable of
   180-degree rotations. The platform is mounted so that the rotation axis is
   oriented perpendicular to the spacecraft X axis and so that its
   extrapolation intersects the spacecraft Z axis.
 
   The charge-energy-mass spectrometer (CHEMS) head will measure the charge
   state and composition of ions in the most energetically important portion
   of the Saturnian magnetospheric plasma.
 
   The ion and neutral camera (INCA) will make two different types of
   measurements. It will obtain with very high sensitivity the
   three-dimensional distribution, velocities, and rough composition of
   magnetospheric and interplanetary ions for those regions in which the
   energetic ion fluxes are very low. The INCA instrument will also obtain
   remote images of the global distribution of the energetic neutral emission
   of hot plasmas in the Saturnian magnetosphere, measuring the composition
   and velocities of those energetic neutrals for each image pixel.
 
 
MIMI Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The field of view parameters for the four detectors that constitute MIMI
   are:
 
            --   Charge-Energy-Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS)
 
            --   Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA)
 
            --   Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurements System 1 (LEMMS1)
 
            --   Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurements System 2 (LEMMS2)
 
           Circular FOVs:
 
           ------------  -------------------
             Detector         Diameter
           ------------  -------------------
              LEMMS1         15.0 degrees
 
              LEMMS2         30.0 degrees
           ------------  -------------------
 
           Rectangular FOVs:
 
           ------------  --------------------  --------------------
             Detector         Horizontal             Vertical
           ------------  --------------------  --------------------
              CHEMS          4.80 degrees         159.0 degrees
 
              INCA           90.0 degrees         120.0 degrees
           ------------  --------------------  --------------------
 
   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   FOV ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe the
   instrument field of view. Since the LEMMS detectors have a circular field
   of view and CHEMS and INCA have rectangular ones, the INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE
   will either be 'CIRCLE' or 'RECTANGLE'. In the case of the LEMMS, GETFOV
   returns a single vector that lies along the edge of the circular cone, and
   for CHEMS and INCA four vectors. All four FOV boresights lie along the
   Z-axis.
 
 
Charge-Energy-Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) FOV Definition
 
   Since CHEMS has a rectangular field of view, four boundary corner vectors
   are returned by GETFOV. This requires two separate views to properly
   visualize. First consider looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_MIMI_CHEMS
   frame at the X=0 plane which permits the computation of the Y components of
   the boundary corner vectors. In the plane the half angle of note is 79.5
   degrees.

   components. This time look up the Y-axis at the Y=0 plane. The half angle
