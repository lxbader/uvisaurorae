   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the Cassini Cosmic Dust Analyzer

   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the CDA detector. (790).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the CDA boresight direction in the CDA
   frame (``CASSINI_CDA'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82790_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
CDA description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   The Cosmic Dust Analyzer Subsystem (CDA) will provide direct observations
   of dust and ice particles in interplanetary space and in the Jupiter and
   Saturn systems. It will investigate the physical, chemical, and dynamical
   properties of these particles matter as functions of the distances to the
   Sun, to Jupiter, to Saturn, and to Saturn's satellites and rings. Finally,
   it will study the interaction of the particles with the Saturnian rings,
   satellites, and magnetosphere.
 
   The four major functional elements of the CDA are the dust analyzer, the
   main electronics, the articulation mechanism, and the high-rate detector
   assembly. For information on these components, see below.
 
   (CDA)
 
   The dust analyzer (DA) consists of the following components: four charge
   pick-up grids; a hemispherical target, an ion collector, an electron
   multiplier, and the sensor electronics. For information on these
   components, see below.
 
   (DA)
 
   The charge pick-up grids collect the initial impact particles. They are
   mounted at the entrance of the sensor.
 
   The hemispherical target is divided into two parts -- a ring-shaped impact
   ionization target and a chemical analyzer target in the middle of the
   ionization target. The chemical analyzer target has an acceleration grid
   mounted 3 mm in front of it.
 
   The ion collector has a grid that is negatively biased in order to collect
   the positively charged plasma ions produced at the impact ionization
   target.
 
   The electron multiplier is located in the center of the hemispherical ion
   collector target. It amplifies the signal produced by ions capable of
   penetrating the ion collector grid. These ions originate from plasma
   produced by particle impact either on the impact ionization target or the
   chemical analyzer target. The output signal from the multiplier differs
   depending upon the target from which impacts are being measured.
 
   The sensor electronics are contained in an electronics box attached to the
   DA sensor chassis. Among other components, this box contains
   charge-sensitive amplifiers (CSAs) that measure the signals from all of the
   grids in the DA.
 
   The CDA main electronics include amplifiers and transient recorders, a
   control and timing unit, a microprocessor unit, a bus interface unit, a
   power input circuit, a low-voltage converter, and a housekeeping system.
 
   All CSA and electron multiplier signals are separately amplified by
   logarithmic amplifiers and then digitized by an analog-to-digital
   converter. The data are stored on transient recorders. Only the recorder
   connected to the pick-up grids is operated continuously. All others are
   activated only by a signal detected at a target or the acceleration grid.
   The control and timing unit stores and decodes information received from
   the microprocessor and produces all timing and synchronization signals
   required for instrument operation.
 
   The microprocessor samples and collects the buffered measurement data,
   coordinates the subsystem measurement cycle, controls the instrument
   operating modes, processes the data according to a program loaded in its
   memory, and outputs data to the spacecraft upon request through the bus
   interface unit (BIU). The BIU is the interface circuit between the
   spacecraft and the microprocessor and is powered by the CDA instrument. The
   power input circuit is the interface with the spacecraft Power and
   Pyrotechnics Subsystem (PPS) and contains a filter circuit and a regulator
   to produce a d.c. voltage to feed the low-voltage converter.
 
   The low-voltage converter is a d.c./d.c. converter that provides different
   regulated low voltages for the electronics circuits and the supply voltage
   for the high-voltage converters. The converters are synchronized to the
   100-kHz clock provided through the BIU from the Command and Data Subsystem
   (CDS).
 
   The CDA housekeeping system is a data system that multiplexes, digitizes,
   and stores information on the instrument current, the low voltages, the
   high voltages, and temperature measurements.
 
   The articulation mechanism (AM) allows the entire CDA instrument, including
   the high-rate detectors, the dust analyzer, the main electronics, and the
   articulation mechanism electronics, to be rotated or repositioned with
   respect to the spacecraft coordinate system.
 
   The high-rate detectors (HRDs) are two redundant independent sensors. The
   electronics for the sensors are contained in the HRD electronics box, and
   each sensor has its own electronics, independent of the other sensor. The
   HRD will be operated in two modes: "normal" mode and "calibrate." In the
   normal mode, the operational HRD continuously collects dust particle data.
   In the calibrate mode, a calibration cycle is initiated, which consists of
   a sequence of pulses sent to the HRD by the in-flight calibrator (IFC) to
   verify the stability of the electronics.
 
 
CDA Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [7] we have:
 
 
           Circular FOVs:
 
           ------------  -------------------
             Detector         Diameter
           ------------  -------------------
               CDA           90.0 degrees
           ------------  -------------------
 
   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   the FOV ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe
   the instrument field of view. Since the CDA has a circular field of view
   the INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE will be 'CIRCLE' The FOV boresight lies along the
   Z-axis in the 'CASSINI_CDA' frame.
 
   Since the CDA detector's FOV is circular and it's diameter is 90 degrees,
   looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_CDA frame, we have: (Note we are
   arbitrarily choosing a vector that terminates in the Z=1 plane.)

                                                Plane X = 0
 
 
   Now from here we see that the Y component of one 'boundary corner' vector
   is:
 
           Y Component = 1.0 * tan ( 45.0 degrees )
                       = 1.0
