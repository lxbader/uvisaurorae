Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the INMS detectors. (OPEN = 740, CLOSED = 741).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the INMS_OPEN boresight direction in
   the INMS frame (``CASSINI_INMS'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82740_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
INMS description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer Subsystem (INMS) will be used to
   study the neutral gases and positive ions in the atmospheres of Saturn and
   Titan and gases in the vicinities of the Saturnian rings and the icy
   satellites. It will also study the magnetosphere of Saturn.
 
   The major functional components of the INMS Subsystem are an open ion
   source, a closed ion source, a quadrupole deflector and lens system, a
   quadrupole mass analyzer, and a dual detector system. For information on
   these components, see below.
 
   (INMS Links)
 
   The open ion source produces ions by ionizing neutral gases. It includes an
   ion trap/deflector that forms trapped ions into a beam. This minimizes
   interaction effects between the gas environment and the open source surface
   as the source directly samples the gaseous species.
 
   The closed ion source also produces ions by ionizing neutral gases. It uses
   ram density enhancement to provide measurements of higher accuracy and
   sensitivity for the more inert atomic and molecular species than provided
   by the open ion source. This is achieved by maintaining a high input flux
   to an enclosed antechamber and then limiting the gas conductance or output
   from the antechamber by the use of an orifice.
 
   Ions are directed to the mass analyzer from the selected ion source by
   changing the potentials on a 90-degree quadrupole deflector. This
   electrostatic device allows both sources of ions to be sequentially
   switched into a common exit lens system.
 
   The quadrupole mass analyzer consists of four precision ground hyperbolic
   rods mounted in a rigid mechanical assembly. The transmitted mass, the
   resolution, and the ion transmission are controlled by variations in RF and
   d.c. electric fields between adjacent rod pairs, while opposite rod pairs
   are kept at the same potential.
 
   The ion dual detector system amplifies and detects the input from the mass
   analyzer by the use of two continuous dynode multipliers.
 
 
INMS Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The field of view parameters for the two detectors that constitute INMS
   are:
 
            --   Open (OPEN)
 
            --   Closed (CLOSED)
 
 
           Circular FOVs:
 
           ------------  -------------------
             Detector         Diameter
           ------------  -------------------
               OPEN           8.0 degrees
              CLOSED        180.0 degrees
           ------------  -------------------
 
   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   the FOV ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe
   the instrument fields of view. Since the INMS has only circular fields of
   view the INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE will always be 'CIRCLE', and GETFOV will always
   return a single boundary corner vector that lies along the edge of the
   circular cones. The FOV boresight lies along the Z-axis in the
   'CASSINI_INMS' frame for both detectors.
 
 
Open (OPEN) FOV Definition
 
   Since the INMS_OPEN detector's FOV is circular and it's diameter is 8.0
   degrees, looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_INMS frame, we have: (Note
   we are arbitrarily choosing a vector that terminates in the Z=1 plane.)

   Now from here we see that the Y component of one 'boundary corner' vector
   is:
 
           Y Component = 1.0 * tan ( 4.0 degrees )
                       = 0.069926812
