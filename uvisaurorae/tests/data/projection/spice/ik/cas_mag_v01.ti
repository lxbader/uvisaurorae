Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the MAG detectors. (45PX = 350, 45MX = 351, 60PX
   = 352, 60MX = 353 ).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the MAG_45PX boresight direction in the
   MAG_PLUS frame (``CASSINI_MAG_PLUS'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82350_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
MAG description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   Magnetometers are direct-sensing instruments that detect and measure the
   strength of magnetic fields in the vicinity of the spacecraft. The Cassini
   Dual-Technique Magnetometer (MAG) measures magnetic fields during the Titan
   and Saturn encounters. The MAG consists of a vector/scalar helium
   magnetometer sensor, a fluxgate magnetometer sensor, a data processing
   unit, three power supplies, plus operating software and electronics
   associated with the sensors.
 
   The vector/scalar helium magnetometer (V/SHM) sensor is used to make both
   vector (magnitude and direction) and scalar (magnitude only) measurements
   of magnetic fields. The V/SHM and its electronics are being supplied by
   JPL. The fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) sensor is used to make vector field
   measurements. This sensor and its electronics are being provided by the
   Imperial College of London.
 
   The instrument data processing unit (DPU) is the responsibility of the
   Technical University of Braunschweig. The DPU interfaces with the
   spacecraft Command and Data Subsystem through the JPL-designed bus
   interface unit (BIU). All commands, data, and processor program changes are
   received or transmitted through the BIU. The MAG components are powered by
   three power supplies plus the 30-volt spacecraft bus. Power supply 0 powers
   the BIU and the DPU. Power supplies 1 and 2 are redundant and power the
   V/SHM electronics. The FGM electronics are powered by the spacecraft bus.
 
   Since magnetometers are sensitive to electric currents and ferrous
   components on the spacecraft, they are generally placed on an extended
   boom, as far from the spacecraft as possible. In this case, the FGM sensor
   is located midway out on the Cassini magnetometer boom, and the V/SHM
   sensor is located at the end of the boom. The boom itself, composed of
   thin, nonmetallic rods, will be collapsed very compactly during launch and
   deployed only after the spacecraft has separated from the launch vehicle.
 
 
MAG Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   The field of view parameters for the four detectors that constitute MAG
   are:
 
            --   45 Degree -- Plus X (45PX)
 
            --   45 Degree -- Minus X (45MX)
 
            --   60 Degree -- Plus X (60PX)
 
            --   60 Degree -- Minus X (60MX)
 
 
           Circular FOVs:
 
           ------------  -------------------
             Detector         Diameter
           ------------  -------------------
               45PX          90.0 degrees
               45MX          90.0 degrees
               60PX         120.0 degrees
               60MX         120.0 degrees
           ------------  -------------------
 
 
   The keywords INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and
   the FOV ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe
   the instrument fields of view. Since the MAG detectors only have circular
   fields of view the INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE will always be 'CIRCLE', and GETFOV
   will return a single boundary vector that lies along the edge of the
   circular cones. The FOV boresight vectors lie along the Z-axis in the
   'CASSINI_MAG_PLUS' or 'CASSINI_MAG_MINUS' frames depending on the direction
   the detector is pointed.
 
 
45 Degree -- Plus X (45PX) FOV Definition
 
   Since the MAG_45PX detector's FOV is circular and it's diameter is 90.0
   degrees, looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_MAG_PLUS frame, we have:
   (Note we are arbitrarily choosing a vector that terminates in the Z=1
   plane.)

   Now from here we see that the Y component of one 'boundary corner' vector
   is:
 
           Y Component = 1.0 * tan ( 45.0 degrees )
                       = 1.0

60 Degree -- Minus X (60MX) FOV Definition
 
   Since the MAG_45MX detector's FOV is circular and it's diameter is 90.0
   degrees, looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_MAG_MINUS frame, we have:
   (Note we are arbitrarily choosing a vector that terminates in the Z=1
   plane.)

   is:

                       = 1.732050808

MAG Pixel Parameters:
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   These parameters describe the pixel structure associated with the
   instruments and their fields of views. In some cases this is a
   generalization of the notion of pixel, in that instead of representing
   pixels on a CCD they may represent a collection of individual detectors.

           relative to the time of transacting the corresponding TRIGGER
