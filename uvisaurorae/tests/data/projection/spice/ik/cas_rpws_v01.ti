Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH
   and CSPICE routine furnsh_c load SPICE kernels as shown below:
 
   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)
 
           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )
 
   C (CSPICE)
 
           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )
 
   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.
 
   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.
 
 
Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF Cassini spacecraft ID number (-82) followed by a
   NAIF three digit code for the RPWS detectors. (RPWS = 730, RPWS_LP = 731 ).
 
   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the RPWS boresight direction in the
   RPWS frame (``CASSINI_RPWS'' -- see [6] ) is specified by:
 
           INS-82730_BORESIGHT
 
   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.
 
   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.
 
 
RPWS description
----------------------------------------------------------
 
   From [3]:
 
   The Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument will be used to
   investigate electric and magnetic waves in space plasma at Saturn. Plasma
   is essentially a soup of free electrons and positively charged ions, the
   latter being atoms that have lost one or more electrons. Plasma makes up
   most of the universe and is created by the heating of gases by stars and
   other bodies in space. Plasma is distributed by the solar wind, and it is
   also "contained" by the magnetic fields (i.e., the magnetoshperes) of
   bodies such as Saturn and Titan. The Cassini RPWS instrument will measure
   the a.c. electric and magnetic fields in the interplanetary medium and
   planetary magnetospheres and will directly measure the electron density and
   temperature of the plasma in the vicinity of the spacecraft.
 
   The major components of the RPWS Subsystem are the electric field sensor,
   the magnetic search coil sensor assembly, the Langmuir probe sensor
   assembly, and the instrument main electronics. For information on these
   components, see below.
 
   (RPWS)
 
   The electric field sensor is made up of three deployable antenna elements,
   an associated preamplifier, and antenna deployment mechanism drive
   electronics. The antennas are composed of interlocking sections made from
   beryllium copper, and each antenna element is deployable separately to 10
   meters with its own 400-Hz a.c. motor. The electric field preamplifier is
   used to add gain to the output signals from the antennas. The antenna
   deployment mechanism electronics convert ±15 volt primary power to 400-Hz
   a.c. power for the antenna drive motors.
 
   The magnetic search coil sensor assembly is composed of a triaxial sensor
   assembly and an associated preamplifier. The triaxial sensor consists of
   three orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular) metallic alloy cores with two sets
   of windings each, one to produce flux in the core and another to detect the
   flux. The magnetic search coil preamplifier adds gain to the output signal
   from the sensor assembly.
 
   The Langmuir probe sensor assembly consists of a sensor, a preamplifier,
   and associated control electronics. The Langmuir probe sensor is a 5-cm
   diameter sphere located at the end of a rod approximately 1 meter in
   length. The sensor rod is folded in a stowed state until deployed in
   flight. The probe sensor preamplifier adds gain to the output from the
   probe.
 
   The RPWS main electronics includes a digital data processing unit, a
   high-frequency receiver, a wideband receiver, a medium-frequency receiver,
   a low-frequency five-channel waveform receiver, the Langmuir probe bias
   circuitry, and a power converter. For information on these components, see
   below.
 
   (RPWS Main Electronics)
 
   The data processing unit (DPU) will control all instrument functions and
   will handle all communications with the orbiter. It will contain a large
   block of RAM to be used as waveform storage for the five-channel waveform
   receiver. Software in the DPU will be used to enhance the scientific return
   of the instrument by performing various analysis and data compression
   operations.
 
   The high-frequency receiver is a digital waveform processor that operates
   by digitizing a portion of the bandwidth received from the lectric field
   sensor antennas and deriving spectral and waveform vector information from
   the waveforms using digital signal processing techniques.
 
   The wideband receiver will obtain very high-resolution electric or magnetic
   field waveforms for selected time intervals that vary from under a minute
   to as much as an hour or more. The receiver has two selectable passbands:
   50 Hz to approximately 10 kHz and 10 kHz to approximately 80 kHz. The
   wideband receiver uses high-rate telemetry to transfer waveform information
   in a given bandwidth from a selected sensor directly. The input signal is
   selectable from one of five inputs: two electric, one magnetic, a
   frequency-converted output from the high-frequency receiver, and the
   Langmuir probe.
 
   The medium-frequency receiver provides spectrum measurements over the
   frequency range from 25 Hz to 12.6 kHz. This receiver is attached to one of
   four sensor inputs (two electric and two magnetic) and uses double
   frequency conversion to convert the input bandwidth down to a low-frequency
   constant frequency band, where it is detected by an amplitude detector.
 
   The low-frequency five-channel waveform receiver provides high-resolution
   spectral measurements of electric and magnetic fields over the frequency
   range from 0.1 Hz to 2.5 kHz. It provides simultaneous waveforms from all
   five antennas (three magnetic axes and two electric axes). This receiver
   captures blocks of waveform data simultaneously from the five sensors and
   maintains a high-degree of phase and amplitude accuracy. The data is
   processed through five parallel amplifier and filter channels.
 
   The Langmuir probe bias circuitry...??(more to follow)
 
   The power converter converts d.c. power from the spacecraft power supplies
   to a.c. power to operate the instrument. The conversion frequency will be
   fixed at 100 kHz by locking onto a signal from the spacecraft bus interface
   unit.
 
 
RPWS Field of View Parameters

   The field of view parameters for the two detectors that constitute the RPWS
   instrument are:

            --   RPWS Langmuir Probe (RPWS_LP)
 
 
Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) FOV Definition
 
   Since the RPWS detector's FOV is circular and it's diameter is 180.0
   degrees. Looking down the X-axis in the CASSINI_RPWS frame, we have: (Note
   since the FOV is 180 degrees in diameter we have the whole Z>=0 halfplane
   in the FOV.)
